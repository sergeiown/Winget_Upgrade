## Release Notes

### Purpose
**Winget Upgrade** simplifies the update process by checking for `winget` availability and upgrading all installed programs that have an update available, with a single command. It ships as a proper per-user installer with automatic updates, and keeps a clear, colored record of everything it does.

### Key Features

- **Winget Availability Check**: Before starting the update, the program checks whether Winget is installed on the system. If Winget is not installed, the program displays an error message and stops execution, providing instructions on how to install it. Next, the program checks the version of Winget and provides upgrade instructions if it's too old.

- **Discovery-first Upgrades**: Uses `winget upgrade` to find only the packages that actually have an update available, filters out anything on the ignore list, shows that list, pauses briefly, then upgrades each package individually via `winget upgrade --id` with a live colored progress bar and ETA.

- **Ignore List**: A plain text `winget_ignore.txt` - one entry per line, matched as a case-insensitive substring, so the exact package identifier isn't required. Reachable straight from the Start Menu.

- **Installer & Autostart**: A signed, per-user Inno Setup installer (no administrator rights needed) with an "run at sign-in" task enabled by default, and Start Menu shortcuts to the app, the ignore list, and the log file.

- **Automatic Updates**: Checks GitHub for a newer release on every launch (with an animated "Checking for updates..." indicator), asks for confirmation, then downloads, installs and restarts silently.

- **Logging**: Records upgrade events and errors in a `winget_upgrade.log` file kept next to the program itself, automatically truncated to stay under 256 KB.

### Recent Changes
- [x] **Critical fix**: the previous two releases failed to start at all (`Pkg: Error reading from file.`). The `rcedit` step added to embed a custom application icon was corrupting the bundle `pkg` embeds in the executable. The icon step has been removed from the build until a safe way to apply it is found.
- [x] Fixed a crash on exit when the console doesn't support raw keyboard input (`process.stdin.setRawMode`), which could close the window right after the summary instead of pausing.
- [x] The "run at sign-in" installer task is now checked by default on every install, including upgrades over a previous version (it used to reset to unchecked on upgrades).
- [ ] Future plans are left to the future.
